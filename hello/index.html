  <p>This is my first post on this blog. Not my first blog post ever though. I
already started many blogs in the past, but none of them really went further
than the customary &quot;Hello blog&quot; initial post.</p>
<p>This time, it's different. I am starting this one from a need: I need to write
down stuff somewhere, and I figured out that a blog would do that perfectly.
More precisely, I want to write down some instructions about setting up private
servers, installing Docker, building clusters, that sort of stuff. So this blog
will be rather technical, at least at the beginning.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago (months?), I stumbled across an article from <a href="https://www.welcometothejungle.com/">Welcome To the
jungle</a> titled &quot;<a href="https://www.welcometothejungle.com/articles/successful-personal-blog-developer">How to Create a Personal Blog as a
Developer</a>&quot;. I leave that here in case I later want to read it
again, as it contains good advices for the newcomer.</p>
<p>About the technology behind this very blog: it is a static site, generated by
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>. It's similar to Jekyll, what I had before (that one only had the
<a href="/pathbot-experiment/">Pathbot experiment</a> that I moved here, that's why this
article is not the oldest), but it feels simpler. I initially wanted to just
update my Jekyll one, but the CLI failed to run because of missing dependencies
or something. I want something simple that doesn't break. Zola being distributed
as a static binary (thank you Rust), this is perfect.</p>
<p>Here are some TODOs, that I should eventually address:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better theme, featuring at least static pages (resume, TODO list) and
categories.</li>
<li>Analytics, but not trackers, because I would like to know if this blog is
having some audience.</li>
</ul>
