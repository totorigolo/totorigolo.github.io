## How to write/hack?

Install Zola, then `zola serve`.

## How to deploy?

Currently, I am using GitHub pages. Zola documentation is
[here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/).

Travis CI is configured to automatically deploy code in the `code` branch
automatically, so just `git push`  to deploy.

## How to anything else?
