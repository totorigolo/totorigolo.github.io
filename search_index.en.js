So this blog\nwill be rather technical, at least at the beginning.\nA few weeks ago (months?), I stumbled across an article from Welcome To the\njungle titled \"How to Create a Personal Blog as a\nDeveloper\". I leave that here in case I later want to read it\nagain, as it contains good advices for the newcomer.\nAbout the technology behind this very blog: it is a static site, generated by\nZola. It's similar to Jekyll, what I had before (that one only had the\nPathbot experiment that I moved here, that's why this\narticle is not the oldest), but it feels simpler. I initially wanted to just\nupdate my Jekyll one, but the CLI failed to run because of missing dependencies\nor something. I want something simple that doesn't break. Zola being distributed\nas a static binary (thank you Rust), this is perfect.\nHere are some TODOs, that I should eventually address:\n\nA better theme, featuring at least static pages (resume, TODO list) and\ncategories.\nAnalytics, but not trackers, because I would like to know if this blog is\nhaving some audience.\n\n","id":"https://blog.busy.ovh/hello/","title":"Let's try something new"},"https://blog.busy.ovh/pathbot-experiment/":{"body":"\n\n\n\n\n\nA little Pathbot experiment.\nSource code\n\nEDIT 2020-07-23: Last year, approx.

We will use HTTPS port (443) with a redirection of\nnon-VPN traffic for potential reverse proxies.\nStep 1: Read Digital Ocean's tutorial\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-debian-10\nStep 2: Configure the VPN over 443\nIn /etc/openvpn/server.conf, change:\nport 443\nproto tcp\nexplicit-exit-notify 0\n\n# This will redirect all non-VPN traffic to this fallback port.\nport-share 127.0.0.1 4443\nRecap: How to create a new client\n\nGenerate a new client certificate/key pair.\n\n# On the OpenVPN server\n./easyrsa gen-req &lt;client-name&gt; nopass\ncp pki/private/client1.key ~/client-configs/keys/\n# transfer key to CA server\n\n# On the CA server\n./easyrsa import-req /path/to/&lt;client-name&gt;.req &lt;client-name&gt;\n./easyrsa sign-req client &lt;client-name&gt;\n# transfer the .crt to the OpenVPN server\n\n\nCreate the client configuration file.\n\n./make_config.sh &lt;client-name&gt;\n","id":"https://blog.busy.ovh/setup-vpn-443/","title":"How to setup your own VPN on port 443"},"https://blog.busy.ovh/setup-vps-debian-docker/":{"body":"In this article, I will describe how I setup my VPS servers based on Debian 10.\nThe goal of this setup is to have a working and secure Docker setup with\nsome monitoring and a few nice tools.\nPassword manager\nI won't elaborate on the absolute necessity to use a password manager. I am\nusing Keepass, and that's more than useful to store all those lengthy passwords.\nI have chosen Keepass because it's free and open source software, and it's very\nsecure. On Windows, I recommend using the official client. On other\nplatforms, I find KeepassXC more stable. Note that both are\ncompatible as they use the same file format to store passwords.\nDebian 10\nThis is on you, as it varies for each cloud provider. I chose Debian because it\ndoesn't evolve too fast, so I can forget it for a while without fear that I am\nlate on updates. To be really safe doing so, I took the following actions:\n\nI subscribed to the Debian security newsletter.\nI skimmed through the Debian Security FAQ.\nI skimmed through the Securing Debian Manual (I hope I\ndidn't overlook something).\n\nCredits: I took inspiration from DigitalOcean's great\ntutorial to write down those instructions. I\nrecommend reading it, as I will not go into the details of the procedure.\nConnecting via SSH and creating a new user\nFrom your computer's terminal:\nssh root@your_server_ip\n\n# Change your root password if you haven't done it yet\npasswd\n\nAs we should not use root when not necessary, we will create a new user right\naway (I will use tlacroix, replace it with whatever username you want). This\nuser will be a super-user, as we will use it for the following steps.\nadduser tlacroix\nusermod -aG sudo tlacroix\n\nWe can take the opportunity to do an update, just in case:\napt update\napt upgrade\nConfiguring SSH key for the new user\nCredits: How to Set Up SSH Keys on Debian\n10.\nRead it for more details.\nCreate a key on your personal computer (use one per computer!) if you don't\nalready have one. From you computer, do:\nssh-keygen -b 4096\n\nI recommend using a passphrase, to stay safe when you forget to lock you\ncomputer.\nNow, we must copy the public key to the server. From your computer, do:\nssh-copy-id username@your_server_ip\n\nNow you don't have to use your user password anymore, but the SSH key\npassphrase.\nSecuring SSH\nNow that we can login as someone else than root without having to type a\npassword, let's forbid root login. Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and update as\nfollows:\nPermitRootLogin no\nPermitEmptyPasswords no\nPasswordAuthentication no  &lt;-- force using SSH keys\n\nThen restart the SSH daemon:\nsudo systemctl restart ssh\nFirewall - Initial setup\nNow is a good time to setup a firewall, to complicate our life to control\nwhat goes in and out of our server. We will come back to it later multiple\ntimes, each time we will need to make a port visible to the outside world.\nI was previously using iptables, but I find it too cumbersome to use. To\npersist its configuration, I created a systemd service running a script during\nboot, located under /etc, that contained calls to iptables to configure it.\nHowever, this file had a non-obvious syntax (iptables CLI, actually), so I'm\nmoving to ufw, the Uncomplicated Firewall.\nTip: if, in the future, you have connectivity issues with some service\nduring initial setup, chances are high that it's because of the firewall. Always\nkeep that in mind.\nFrom your server:\n# Install UFW\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install ufw\n\n# Allow OpenSSH (otherwise we would be locked out)\nsudo ufw allow OpenSSH\n\n# Only do *after* the previous command\nsudo ufw enable\n\n# To have the current status of the firewall\nsudo ufw status verbose\n\nNow, if by accident you do get locked out of your server because of the\nfirewall, have a look for \"KVM\" in your provider's management interface, and\nsearch the net for instructions.\nUnattended Upgrades\nLast but not least, let's configure Unattended Upgrades. Quoting the official documentation:\n\nThe purpose of unattended-upgrades is to keep the computer current with the\nlatest security (and other) updates automatically.\nIf you plan to use it, you should have some means to monitor your systems,\nsuch as installing the apt-listchanges package and configuring it to send you\nemails about updates. And there is always /var/log/dpkg.log, or the files in\n/var/log/unattended-upgrades/.\n\nLet's set everything up. I will only write down the commands with some comments.\nRefer the the official documentation for more details.\nsudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges\ndpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades\nEmail configuration, to be notified during upgrades\nTo be notified by emails, update /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Mail \"root\";\n\nCredits: Redirection to the mailbox\nTODO: Configure encryption.\n# Install and configure postfix + mailx\nsudo apt-get install postfix mailutils\n## Chose \"Internet mail\" if domain name, otherwise \"Local only\"\n\n# Setup redirection from local emails to external mailbox (only if \"Internet Mail\")\nsudoedit /etc/aliases\n## Add: root: my-email@mail-provider.net\nsudo newaliases\nsudo systemctl restart postfix\n\n# Test it (look in your spam folder)\necho \"This is a test.\" | mail -s \"Test email from server\" root\n\nPhew, now Debian is configured.\nMiscellaneous tools\nThose tools are not mandatory, but I find them convenient.\nNecessary tools\nThose are just must have:\nsudo apt install curl\nMosh - Mobile SH\nhttps://mosh.org/\nSSH connections easily hang up and disconnect, if your laptop goes to sleep or\nyour phone changes antenna. To solve this problem, I use Mosh, that basically\nnever dies.\nsudo apt-get install mosh\n\n# Allow 20 simultaneous connections in the firewall\nsudo ufw allow 60001:60020/udp\n\nNow, you should be able to use Mosh instead of SSH:\nmosh user@server-ip\ntmux - Terminal multiplexer\ntmux is another way of solving the disconnection issue I just mentioned, but is\nnot limited to that: as the name suggests, it enable multiplexing terminal, i.e.\nhaving multiple terminals inside one. I won't elaborate much, because that would\nrequire yet another post, and because the net is full of good resources.\nsudo apt install tmux\n\n# Basic how-to\n## To run it, do only once, or after restarts of the server\ntmux\n## To attach to a running session\ntmux a\n\ntmux special key is Ctrl+B. Then, if you need quick help, use Ctrl+B, ?.\nranger - VIM-inspired file manager\nhttps://github.com/ranger/ranger\nsudo apt install ranger\n\n# To use it:\nranger\n\nTo get started, read ranger's GitHub page.\nhtop - interactive process viewer\nhttps://hisham.hm/htop/\nsudo apt install htop\n\n# To use it:\nhtop\nhtop -u user\n\nIf you want to hide threads (lines in green): F2 &gt; Display options &gt; Hide userland\nprocess threads.\nEarlyOOM - kills hungry processes early\nLinux features an Out-Of-Memory Killer (OOM killer) that will terminate one or\nmore processes to free up memory for the system when the available memory is\nexhausted. It selects the process to kill based on complex heuristics. However,\nit is not configurable and I often found that it triggered too late.\nEarlyOOM does the same job, but at a configurable threshold.\nsudo apt install earlyoom\n\nsudo systemctl status earlyoom\n\n# To reduce the threshold to 4%\nsudoedit /etc/default/earlyoom\n## EARLYOOM_ARGS=\"-r 60 -m 4\"\nsudo systemctl restart earlyoom\n\nThe default threshold is at 10%, where a SIGTERM is sent, and 5% with a SIGKILL.\nI reduced from 10% to 4% because my server is short on resources an I have\nhungry services.\nMonitoring and alerting with Netdata\nI won't elaborate on the necessity to have monitoring and alerting for an\ninfrastructure. Netdata is a free and open source solution\njust for that.\nI choose to install it independently as Docker, i.e. no as a Docker container,\nto isolate it from Docker failures.\nI recommend heading to the official website for instructions:\nhttps://learn.netdata.cloud/.\nTL;DR: If you want the stable channel:\nsudo apt install curl\nbash &lt;(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh) --stable-channel\n\nNow, head to: http://localhost:19999... And that won't\nwork, because the firewall won't let us enter. You can open the port as below,\nread the following section or use a reverse-proxy such as Caddy or Nginx. Your\nchoice :)\nsudo ufw allow 19999\nNetdata Cloud\nInstead of opening a port and configuring your firewall, you can opt to use\nNetdata Cloud instead. That's a free service to monitor as many\nservers as you want (and offer them a backdoor in your infrastructure). Their\nwebsite is clear enough, so I won't go into the procedure.\nhttps://www.netdata.cloud/\nSmall break: Break it all\nNow is time to see how our system behaves in presence of failure. We have\nEarlyOOM to kill bad processes (remember, it checks every 60 seconds by\ndefault), Mosh that will never die, Netdata to alert us (it has default\nalert rules) and postfix to forward emails right to our mailbox.\nAn easy and efficient way to hang the system is the fork bomb (explanations\nhere). Type that and observe:\n:(){ :|:&amp; };:\n\n... Ok, EarlyOOM didn't help, and emails from postfix came afterwards or not at\nall because the system was busy. But I don't have an idea for a fast way to\nbreak it other than the fork bomb. Still, you should see red on Netdata Cloud\ndashboard.\nDepending on your luck, your server will recover or not. If it does not, just\nhead to your management website and reboot it.\nDocker\nNow let's go with Docker. I won't introduce it, again, the net is full of good\nresources. As usual, I recommend reading the official instructions on the\nwebsite:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/\nBut here is a recap:\n# Install necessary prerequisites\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install \\\n    apt-transport-https \\\n    ca-certificates \\\n    curl \\\n    gnupg2 \\\n    software-properties-common\n\n# Add Docker's official PGP key\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n\n# Verify the key\n# Should be: 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88\nsudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88\n\n# Add the stable Docker repository\nsudo add-apt-repository \\\n   \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \\\n   $(lsb_release -cs) \\\n   stable\"\n\n# Install Docker Engine - Community\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n\n# Verify the install\nsudo docker run hello-world\n\n# Add your user to the docker group to avoid having to use sudo each time\nsudo usermod -aG docker &lt;user&gt;\n# You need to logout and login\ndocker run hello-world\n\n# Install docker-compose\nsudo apt install docker-compose\n\n\nIn future articles:\n\nCaddy or Traefik?\nDocker Swarm vs Kubernetes\nDocker Swarm\nSwarmpit\n\n","id":"https://blog.busy.ovh/setup-vps-debian-docker/","title":"How to setup a VPS - Debian, Docker"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.busy.ovh/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.busy.ovh/hello/":{"body":144,"title":4},"https://blog.busy.ovh/pathbot-experiment/":{"body":79,"title":2},"https://blog.busy.ovh/setup-vpn-443/":{"body":141,"title":4},"https://blog.busy.ovh/setup-vps-debian-docker/":{"body":1072,"title":4}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
